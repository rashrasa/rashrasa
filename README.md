🛜 Networking Protocols

🏙️ Distributed Systems

🎛️ Signals and Control Systems

## Currently Developing

### [Blind Maze](https://github.com/rashrasa/blind-maze)

A full stack multiplayer web game that consists of:

#### Server

A basic websocket server written in Go which facilitates communications between clients.

#### Client

![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Typescript-blue)

A canvas-based component which renders the game, connects to the server, handles inputs and also handles game logic elements such as collisions. Written in typescript.

#### Frontend

## Current Position

I currently work at Quasar Consulting Group as part of the Automation Team. I've been working part-time during Fall/Winter terms and full-time in the Summer term since July 2024.

### What I've Helped Build

An offline-first, full-stack (CRUD) app with Flutter + Supabase. I...

- Designed and developed an offline image processing pipeline that enables users to work in areas with low connectivity. Uses **RxDart** to merge remote and local data.

- Implemented **Riverpod** state management to reduce frequent and unnecessary UI re-builds

A Microsoft Word processing desktop app with C#, .NET 9.0, Word Interop and libraries like WinUI 3 and OpenXML. I designed and implemented...

- Multi-threading to speed up slow tasks like using Word interop to process documents.

- Caching results of heavy calculations _(such as calculating page numbers which requires rendering the word document in the background)_ on Word documents that don't tend to change frequently to avoid doing unnecessary work

- Thread safety by using semaphores, locks, concurrency-safe collections

- Project-scoping, inspired by VS Code, where any user can open a project and be back where they (or someone else) left off

- User-friendly UI using the Model-View-ViewModel framework and libararies such as CommunityToolkit.MVVM
